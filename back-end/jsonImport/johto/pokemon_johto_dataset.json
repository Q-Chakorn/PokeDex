A soothing aroma wafts from the leaf, which can calm battling Pok\u00e9mon. The leaf is also used to sense temperature and humidity. Chikorita actively seeks out and enjoys the sun's warmth. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep, Chikorita uses the leaf to search for the coziest place to sleep in. On occasion, Chikorita can be seen relaxing as it sleeps due to finding a great spot. Chikorita can be found in grasslands. However, due to its status as a first partner Pok\u00e9mon, a wild Chikorita is hard to come by and it is generally found under the ownership of Trainers. It has been recently seen living in the Terarium of Blueberry Academy. Chikorita has a docile nature. Chikorita evolves into Bayleef, which evolves into Meganium.",

Most of its body is cream-colored, but its back and the top of its head are a dark green-blue. It has a short, rounded snout and small, triangular eyes and ears. When its mouth is open, its sharp canine teeth and thick tongue are visible. Each of its paws has five digits and there is a coarse, spiky fringe of fur along its rear. Across the back of its neck, several red spots can produce fire. Typhlosion is capable of making anything go up in flames when angered and creating explosions by rubbing its fur together. The heat it generates when ready for battle creates a shimmering haze that can also be used to hide itself. When fully enraged, anything Typhlosion touches instantly goes up in flames. Though it is rare in the wild, it can be found living on grasslands. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep, Typhlosion is known to toss and turn while sleeping. It is recommended to avoid a sleeping Typhlosion due to it unleashing blasts fires from its back by accident. Typhlosion has a regional form: Hisuian Typhlosion. Hisuian Typhlosion's appearance is believed to have been influenced by the energy emanating from Mount Coronet at the center of the Hisui region. Its ears droop beside its head. The fur on its back is a purplish-blue color, and extends to the front of its neck, forming a collar pattern. It has fire-producing spots all around its neck, covering the collar pattern, and these spots produce flames that wisp in a bright magenta red color. Hisuian Typhlosion has graceful and refined movements, and a gentler, more pacifistic nature compared to Johtonian Typhlosion. It can often be seen staring into space; it is assumed that as Hisuian Typhlosion does this, it looks at the flow of life energy and searches for wayward spirits and lost souls to eat. It is believed that Hisuian Typhlosion purifies spirits with its flames as it eats them before it guides them back to the afterlife where they belong. Despite its peaceful nature, Hisuian Typhlosion can lose control of its emotions when sufficiently angered and can unleash ghost flames that can incinerate its opponents until nothing remains. It can emit a total of 108 ghost flames from the spots on its neck. Once unleashed, every single ghost flame attacks its opponents while taking on the appearance of ferocious beasts.

The wings themselves are transparent. Its main body and lower jaw are yellow, while the rest of its head is red. It has large, round eyes and a pair of black antennae. The antennae are shorter on the female than on the male. It has six black legs with white hands that resemble boxing gloves. Ledyba is a social Pok\u00e9mon that is active in large groups. If left alone, it becomes timid and afraid to move. It is also very sensitive to cold, so it forms clusters with other Ledyba for warmth. An aromatic fluid is secreted from its feet and leg joints, which it uses for communication. The fluid indicates its location and conveys emotion; it will smell sour if Ledyba is angry. In the anime, Ledyba has been shown to serve a role in pollinating fruit-producing plants and is usually instructed to do so by means of a special whistle. However, like most Pok\u00e9mon, it will also respond to regular vocal commands. Ledyba builds its nest on leaves in temperate forests and jungles and joins with other Ledyba to protect its home when needed. As shown in Pok\u00e9mon Super Mystery Dungeon and Pok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Rescue Team DX, they sleep in groups of four. Ledyba evolves into Ledian.",

Mareep is an ovine Pok\u00e9mon with fluffy cream-colored wool covering its entire body, as well as a curly tuft of wool in the middle of its head. Its head is blue, and it has black eyes. Its four feet are blue and have two digits on each foot, and it appears to be on tiptoe at all times. Its conical ears and tail have a yellow-and-black striped pattern. Mareep has an orange sphere at the end of its tail, which acts like a small light bulb. This sphere glows brighter the more electricity and heat it has. Mareep's wool grows continuously and stores electricity, rubbing together and building a static charge. Its volume increases when it builds up with electricity. Touching the wool when it is charged will result in a static shock. During the summer, the fleece is shed, but it grows back in a week. Air is also stored in its fur, which allows it to stay cool during summer and warm during winter. It tends to avoid battles in the wild and has a mild disposition. Mareep is most often found in grassy fields, though it can also be found in farms where its wool is used in high-quality clothing. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep, Mareep is known to roll over in its sleep. Mareep evolves into Flaaffy, which evolves into Ampharos.",

This mane forms sideways curls on the top of its head. It has stubby arms and one nail on each foot. Flaaffy's long tail has black stripes and is tipped with a blue orb. Storing too much electricity caused Flaaffy to lose the wool over most of its body, but the bare, rubbery skin protects it from the electricity stored in its fleece. The quality of Flaaffy's fleece can change to generate more electricity with less wool. The orb will light up when Flaaffy's mane is fully charged, and it can attack by firing electrified hairs at opponents. Flaaffy typically inhabits grassy meadows and fields, though it can also be found in farms, where its wool is used to create high-quality clothing.

Ampharos is a yellow, bipedal ovine Pok\u00e9mon with a white belly. It has conical ears with black stripes and a red orb on its forehead. Its long neck has several black rings around it near the base. Its stubby arms resemble flippers and each foot has a single white nail. It has a long, black-striped tail with a red orb at the tip. The orb on its tail can shine so bright, that it can be seen from space. People have used the light as a beacon, or to send signals across the ocean. Ampharos is generally found in grasslands, though it can also be found in farms alongside its pre-evolved forms Mareep and Flaaffy. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep, the tail light of a sleeping Ampharos can sometimes seen in the distance at night.The reason is due to Ampharos forgetting to turn off its tail light before going to sleep. Ampharos can Mega Evolve into Mega Ampharos. As Mega Ampharos, its toes turn black and it regrows white wool at the back of its head and over its tail, having its genes stimulated by Mega Evolution. This energy also awakens its long-sleeping dragon blood. Its long wooly tail has many small, red orbs attached to it. Its conical ears retain their stripes but are now segmented with swirled tips. When it increases the amount of electrical energy within itself, the red orbs on its body and wool emit a strong light. Ampharos evolves from Flaaffy and is the final form of Mareep.",

Originally, it was incorrectly believed to be a Grass-type. Sudowoodo disguises itself as a tree and stands along paths to avoid being attacked. Sudowoodo's camouflage fails in the winter, as its forelegs remain green, unlike real trees. Sudowoodo is very weak to water and hates it, so whenever it starts to rain, it will break their disguise and flee to the nearest source of shelter. Because it holds its position for so long, its arms have become supple yet strong. It is popular with the elderly, with available magazines and fans devoted to its arm angle and length. Sudowoodo can be found living in forests, sometimes sharing a habitat with Trevenant. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep, Sudowoodo is known to keep its tree mimicry even when sleeping.

Paldean Wooper evolves into Clodsire starting at level 20. Wooper is a mostly blue, amphibious Pok\u00e9mon that resembles an upright, armless axolotl. Wooper's head is large compared to its body, and it has small, round, black eyes. It has purple, branching gills on either side of its head; the males have more branches in its gills than the females. Wooper stands on two small, round feet, and it has a large, thick tail. On its belly are dark blue curved markings. It is implied in the anime that Wooper is a dull-witted Pok\u00e9mon oblivious to its surroundings. Wooper lives in cold water most of the time. When sleeping, it partially buries itself in the mud at the bottom. It will occasionally leave the water when the air cools in the evening to search for food along the shore. While walking on land, it coats its body with a slimy, toxic film that keeps its skin from dehydrating and insulates against the cold. The film causes a shooting pain if touched barehanded. It is a timid Pok\u00e9mon and tends to stay close to Quagsire. Arbok is a natural predator of Wooper. Wooper has a regional form: Paldean Wooper. Wooper in the Paldea region has a brown coloration, with two pairs of bone-shaped gills branching from its head, as well as an eight-pronged pattern on its stomach. Paldean Wooper once lived in the water during ancient times until they were forced out of their territory. As a result, they gradually adapted to living on land, namely in marshes. Paldean Wooper employs two adaptations to allow it to survive on land: its gills have hardened, and it coats its body with a poisonous film that keeps it from drying out. However, these adaptations resulted in Paldean Wooper having heavy bodies and being only able to move really slowly. To defend itself, Paldean Wooper can use its gills to unleash a powerful poisonous liquid. Paldean Wooper travel and work together in groups of three or four, and enlist the help of their evolutionary relative, Clodsire, to ferry them across water. Despite the adaptational change, Paldean Wooper can still float or swim in the water. Wooper evolves into Quagsire. Paldean Wooper evolves into Clodsire. Wooper Paldean Wooper",

Its head is broad and round, having little neck to distinguish it from the rest of its body. It has a wide mouth and tiny, black eyes. A wavy, purple stripe runs down its back. Along its spine is a dark blue fin, which is larger on the male than on the female. Quagsire's hands and feet both have three digits. Its outer layer of skin is slimy and slippery. Quagsire shares many similarities with its Paldean relative, Clodsire. Quagsire is carefree and sluggish by nature, although it is protective towards Wooper. An unintelligent Pok\u00e9mon, it tends to bump its head inadvertently while swimming and seems not to care. It hunts for food by leaving its mouth wide open in water and waiting for its unaware prey to blunder in. Because Quagsire does not move, it does not get very hungry and can afford to wait for its food. Quagsire lives in clean bodies of freshwater, as well as muddy swamps. During the day, Quagsire avoids sunlight by submerging itself in the water. In the anime, wild Quagsire are shown to have an annual celebration at Blue Moon Falls when the moon is full. There they attempt to shoot round objects they have collected to the top of a waterfall with their attacks, to see who can launch their objects the highest, with the apparent target being the moon.

The shaggy feathers on its tail resemble the end of a broom, and there is a thin, red band at the base of the tail. Its yellow feet have four toes, three facing forward and one backward. Murkrow awakens at dusk and moves during the night. It has a fondness for anything sparkly, and it will go as far as fighting with other Pok\u00e9mon, such as Meowth or Gabite, in order to gain their stashes. However, it is also known to give these sparkly objects to Trainers that it is fond of. Whenever it is chased, it loses the attacker by leading it down dark mountain trails, and sometimes it does this to travelers as a mean-spirited prank. Its thieving and nocturnal nature has led it to become representative of misfortune. It was believed that saying, \"Workrum, Workrum\u2014bad luck, don't come,\" would serve as a protective incantation to drive away bad luck caused by seeing a Murkrow. It is possible to train a Murkrow to repeat words, as seen under Team Rocket's ownership. Murkrow usually live in flocks amongst forests and swamps. Murkrow may also act as a servant of Honchkrow; with groups of at least 100 flying in at Honchkrow's call.

It has five round red gems halfway around its neck, which are used to absorb fear and use it as nourishment.

As a nocturnal Pok\u00e9mon, it spends its days sleeping in darkness and its nights startling people with mischievous tricks. Since it loves watching frightened people, it is known to yank and bite at people's hair or sneak up on them and cry and shriek in a way a child would. In the anime, Misdreavus is shown to be able to use its \"hair\" to grasp objects and other Pok\u00e9mon, as if it were hands. Flutter Mane shares a resemblance to Misdreavus.

All of them are known as One form, as seen in the Pok\u00e9dex. In Generation II, there were 26 Unown forms based on Latin alphabet characters. In Generation III, two new forms were introduced as well: ? and ! . The Unown forms are chronicled in the Unown Mode and the Unown Report. In Generation II, its shape is determined by its individual values; in Generation III, it is determined by its personality value; from Generation IV onwards, it is determined by a separate form identifier. Unown is a flat, thin Pok\u00e9mon shaped like an eye with appendages that make it resemble a letter or a punctuation mark. It is entirely black, except for its white sclerae. All 26 alphabetic forms of Unown have fully open eyes, while the two punctuation forms have half-closed eyes. Though each of its forms has a counterpart in the Latin alphabet, Unown is said to resemble ancient writing and hieroglyphs. It is a mystery whether Unown predates or postdates written language, and therefore which one is based on the other. Unown can move its appendages independently like tentacles or fingers. The Pok\u00e9dex and Professor Oak's research disagree on whether Unown communicates using electromagnetic waves or telepathy. Either way, it can be detected by the Pok\u00e9gear radio, which interprets it as the melody of the Azure Flute. Unown has an unknown connection to Arceus. It is said that an \"odd power\" emerges when more than one Unown come together. In Generation VIII, Hidden Power is Unown's signature move. Certain Unown loose in the Hisui region were capable of repelling Pok\u00e9 Balls that contained Pok\u00e9mon, preventing them from being battled. Professor Laventon's research observed that Unown resemble human writing from other lands, though no one took him seriously. In the anime, it is shown to be capable of reading the thoughts of other life forms. Great numbers of Unown are capable of distorting reality to suit the dreams and wishes of whoever is in control of the Unown. However, they can only do this when more Unown are present, so it could be a shared effort rather than an ability unique to each Unown. Unown is an extremely rare Pok\u00e9mon that lives in its own dimension and rarely ventures outside. When it moves to the Pok\u00e9mon world, Unown tends to stick to walls like engravings of ancient texts, or orbit other Unown, usually in ruins.

Granbull is a purple, bipedal, bulldog-like Pok\u00e9mon. It has a prominent lower jaw with two long, fang-like growths. Its upper jaw has two small fangs. The jaws are so heavy that the Pok\u00e9mon has trouble keeping its head up. On the sides of its head are flat, curved ears, and its small nose is black. There is a black collar around its neck with two small white markings on it. Around its wrists are two black band markings, and it has a short tail. A Granbull's main weapons are its well-developed lower jaw and heavy fangs. The bite from its jaws is said to be very powerful. However, due to how heavy its jaws are, Granbull keeps its head tilted down constantly for balance. Despite its fierce appearance, it is actually very timid and sensitive, even more so than Snubbull. Granbull rarely bites as it prefers not to get involved in disputes. Unless Granbull is startled, it will not bite indiscriminately. If attacked, it will flail about to fend off its attacker. Granbull is popular with young people due to how it acts and looks. It is considered too incompetent to be a guard dog due to its nature. Granbull wanders around urban areas. Granbull evolves from Snubbull.",

It can lift and throw objects 100 times its own weight. It uses its two antennae to search for food by scent. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep, Heracross is known to occasionaly sleep while licking the sap it finds.The reason is due to Heracross becoming exhausted from a potentinally hard search for sweet sap. It lives in boreal, temperate, and tropical forests, where it feeds on tree sap. In Generation II, Megahorn was its signature move. As seen in the anime, Heracross has been known to compete with Pok\u00e9mon such as Pinsir for food. The same episode also shows Heracross allowing Butterfree to feed on tree sap after Heracross has finished its meal. In addition, it is shown to suck sap from Grass-type Pok\u00e9mon such as Bulbasaur. In Alola, Heracross get along better with Pinsir, as they both have rivalries with Vikavolt.",

Corsola is a small, pink, roundish Anthozoan Pok\u00e9mon with branch-like growths on its back, which are similar to coral. There is a smaller, blunt horn on its forehead, and it has black, oval eyes. It has a light-blue underside, which speckles towards the sides. Its four legs and two arms are blunt and stubby. Smaller Pok\u00e9mon like Horsea and Luvdisc are sometimes sheltered by Corsola's branches, and even offer it protection from foes. Corsola's horn is a prized material, commonly used for jewelry and carving, as seen in the anime. Some people keep Corsola branches as charms to promote safe childbirth. Corsola's branches glitter very beautifully in seven colors when they catch sunlight. If any branch breaks off, this Pok\u00e9mon grows it back in just one night. Found in the warm shallow waters of southern seas, Corsola requires clean water to live. If its habitat is dirty, the growths on its back become discolored and degenerate. However, when it is healthy, its growths regularly shed and grow back; it is able to regrow them over the course of a single night. It forms large social groups. Occasionally, these groups get so large that people may live atop them, as is the case in Pacifidlog Town. In the Alola region, Mareanie and Toxapex are natural predators of Corsola, preying on its branches. If pursued by them, Corsola will sometimes snap its own branches off as a diversion. Conversely, Mareanie and Toxapex do not prey on Corsola in the Galar region, having not developed a taste for its branches. Corsola has a regional form: Galarian Corsola. Galarian Corsola were wiped out by sudden changes in the climate and ocean temperature, turning them into Ghost-types.

They cannot cause injuries or pain, but they can be used to take root inside and drain the life force of others, and will immobilize the victim until Galarian Corsola lets them go.

It was once believed that Remoraid would not truly evolve into Octillery, due to their vastly differing appearances. Remoraid is well known for its ability to shoot jets of water out of its mouth with incredible accuracy and distance. It uses its abdominal muscles to do so, often to shoot down prey, such as Burmy, out of the air. The water attack can reach its prey from over 300 feet away, even when the prey is moving or flying. Because of this, Remoraid is referred to as the \"sniper of the seas.\" When threatened, it can also shoot water to propel itself backward.

Its ink can also be used as a cooking ingredient. Besides ink, Octillery sometimes uses its rock-hard head on its foes. Prior to Generation VIII, Octazooka was its signature move, but other Pok\u00e9mon could still inherit it via breeding. Octillery is normally found in oceans and caves. For a long time, people refused to believe Octillery was an evolution of Remoraid, because of the extreme physical differences between the two. It is thought to be a distant relative to Omastar. In New Pok\u00e9mon Snap, an Octillery can be seen about to be preyed on by a Seviper. Octillery evolves from Remoraid.",

It normally gives stored food to its chicks, but has been known to share its food with humans stranded on icy mountains. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep, Delibird is known to sleep while occasionally reaching inside its tail to pull something out. Prior to Generation IX, Delibird was the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Present by leveling up. Present allows it to carry special items in its tail that may cause damage or heal its opponent. In a flock, the Delibird with the largest tail is its leader. Delibird tends to live in mountainous regions, making its nests over sharp cliffs; notably around Mt. Everest.

Mantine thrives in open seas where it swims freely, often in schools where they race one another. It can breach out of the water and fly 300 feet into the air if it builds up enough speed. In the past, it was often misidentified as a bird Pok\u00e9mon by observers who saw this behavior. Mantine is sometimes seen with a Remoraid attached to the underside of one of its fins, scavenging for its leftovers and fighting together with it when attacked. Mantine has a docile nature, and does not mind the Remoraid clinging onto its fin. In Alola, many surfers ride waves and travel between islands on the backs of Mantine.

Its feet have three toes on them, two in front and one in back, and its tail has hooked ends. Its steel wings become tattered and bashed in from repeated battles, but once a year the battered wings grow back completely. This process restores the cutting edges of its feathers, which are sharp enough to be used as blades and sharper than any man-made sword. Its skin and feathers are solid due to being raised in very harsh conditions. Its nests are usually found in thorn bushes, where continual scratching of a young individual's skin will eventually harden it into an iron-like state. However, water can cause Skarmory's hard body to rust easily, so it stays in its nest on rainy days. In ancient regions where these Pok\u00e9mon are common, warriors would use the sharp feathers that fell off Skarmory as swords. It is a popular Pok\u00e9mon that is used for heraldic designs, and in Galar, it has violent territorial clashes with Corviknight. In Blueberry Academy, Skarmory is used for the school's Flying Taxi service. In Generation V, Steel Wing was its signature move, but other Pok\u00e9mon could still inherit it via breeding.",

The one with its horns raked sharply towards the back serves a leadership role. Leadership is determined by fights within the pack. It is believed that Houndoom dreams about this leadership role while it sleeps. Its gut is full of toxins, which are used to create unique fire mixed with poison. This gives Houndoom's fire a foul odor and the burns it inflicts will never heal. After finishing off its prey, Houndoom divides it evenly among its pack. Houndoom appears near rough terrain areas. Its howling induces shivering in other Pok\u00e9mon, and often sends them scurrying back to their nests. In the past, people thought Houndoom's howl came from the grim reaper. Houndoom usually breathes fire when it is angry. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep, Houndoom is known to rarely breathe out flames while it sleeps. Houndoom can Mega Evolve into Mega Houndoom.

The ridge at the base of Mega Houndoom's neck is longer and curves forward towards its shoulders. Instead of a band with a skull pendant, there is a large, toothed structure around its neck. This bone-like formation has two large spikes on either side and three pointed teeth on the bottom. Mega Houndoom's horns now point straight up with a small, outward curve in the middle. The two bands on its hind legs have vanished, and those on its forelegs are broken in the front. Its claws are a dark red due to its ability to generate more heat, which causes pain to Mega Houndoom.

Its four short legs are each encircled with a broken, black band and have three toes. Donphan has the ability to curl up into a ball and violently roll around like a wheel. These rolling tackles are strong enough to knock down a house. While normally calm, Donphan can become enraged and start a rampage. Once it starts its rampage, it will be almost unstoppable. Donphan will chase after anyone who angers it. The anime shows that this ability is further used as a form of courtship. The male Donphan have rolling competitions to demonstrate their toughness to the females. A Donphan's tough hide is so strong, not even a car can scratch it. Despite this, the armor is extremely vulnerable to rain. It has been demonstrated that Donphan has a keen sense of smell, capable of sniffing out a gem known as amberite . Donphan travels in herds with a ranking system. The larger its tusks, the higher its rank in the herd. It lives in rough, mountainous terrain. Both Great Tusk and Iron Treads share a resemblance to Donphan. Great Tusk is theorized to be Donphan's ancient ancestor from the dinosaur era, while Iron Treads is believed to be a descendant of Donphan or a scientific weapon sent to the Pok\u00e9mon world by aliens.

Staring into them creates an odd sensation, as if one is being sucked through them, and one may become so dizzy that it is impossible to stand. The orbs on the antlers have a pleasant scent, which can induce a bewildering effect on people. The orbs can also be ground into a powder that aids in sleeping. Stantler's strange antlers were very valuable as works of art, and as such, the species was nearly hunted to extinction. Stantler live in herds in temperate, mountainous forests; these herds are sometimes led by a Wyrdeer. As shown in the anime, a baby Stantler that is separated from its herd and frightened will instinctively produce an illusion of a big, stampeding herd to scare away perceived threats.

There are several tufts of hair sticking up on top of its head. Its skin is light purple with a cream-colored chest, arms, and feet. It has large, blue-green eyes and a pair of large, pink lips.

This Pok\u00e9mon is very active and runs about, although it often falls. Being very conscious of its appearance, it will check its reflection when given the chance to make sure it is not dirty.

Prior to Generation VI, Miltank was the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Milk Drink. The milk that it produces is sweet and very nutritious, and can be used to heal Pok\u00e9mon and ill or weary humans. Drinking a large amount of Miltank's milk will cause the Pok\u00e9mon or person to gain weight and develop stomach pains. The taste and nutrition of its milk improves with the quality of the pastures it lives in, and the taste itself changes with the season. It can produce over five gallons of milk per day, which in turn can be turned into yogurt or enjoyed unchanged by children and adults alike. Miltank can become ill if it is not milked every day. Miltank lives in grasslands, and is also raised on farms. Miltank has been supporting the lives of people and other Pok\u00e9mon since ancient times with its ability to produce milk.",

Raikou has two long fangs that make its appearance similar to the saber-toothed cat. Its large claws each converge to form a single point and never retract. Extra fur hangs off its body in front of its thighs. Raikou has a mane across its back that resembles dull purple rain clouds and allows it to shoot bolts of lightning. A proverb claims that Raikou descended from the sky with a lightning bolt. Raikou is able to fly by creating storm clouds, as depicted in the Pok\u00e9mon Ranger: Guardian Signs .

According to Occulture, Raging Bolt is believed to be an ancestor of Raikou. As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex, while Raikou is sleeping, its breath makes a rumbling sound similar to distant thunder. The moment Raikou awakens, it will quickly travel the lands, with a roar sounding similar to a crashing thunder. Raikou is known to enjoy eating Raikou Biscuits.

There is a gray, diamond-shaped patch of scales covering its belly and a smaller one on its back. It has three claws on its feet and hands. A ring of spikes surrounds the tip of its tail. Tyranitar is a powerful Pok\u00e9mon with an insolent nature, uncaring of others. It is extremely strong, and its thick, rocky hide gives it good resistance to all forms of attack. As mentioned in Pok\u00e9mon Sleep, Tyranitar sleeps with no fear thanks to this overwhelming power and strong body. As it is not worried about surroundings even in its sleep, Tyranitar can be seen sleeping in an amazing sleeping position with its limbs open wide. As a result, Tyranitar is always looking for a battle and will not flinch at anything, though it ignores opponents that it thinks are not worth its time. Tyranitar's power is so devastating that it can forcefully crush anything using one of its hands. If enraged, Tyranitar sets off outstanding earthquakes that can completely change the entire landscape, destroying houses and mountains, and often forcing cartographers to draw up new maps. It lives in nests made from demolished mountains. In the Galar region, it has a fierce rivalry with Duraludon, which it shares its habitat with, often battling each other in the mountains. Iron Thorns is believed to be a relative of Tyranitar from one billion years in the future. Prior to Generation IV, Sand Stream was Tyranitar's signature Ability. Tyranitar can Mega Evolve into Mega Tyranitar. Mega Tyranitar has more gaps in its armor than its normal form, with four new triangular holes along the sides of its neck and one on its throat. The four holes on its chest are now larger with the top two containing red ovals. While the spikes along the back of its neck grow shorter, the ones on its head elongate to form prominent ridges along its brows. The center spike on its head becomes a long, upright horn. Its chest plate expands, curving over its shoulders and along its back to form three long, irregular spikes on each side of its body. The scales on Mega Tyranitar's belly have now become red instead of blue and seethe with energy, enabling it to emanate more power. It gains two sharp spikes on its knees, as well as more prominent leg joints. Its tail lengthens, with the three spikes surrounding its tip growing upward and outward. Its back had split open because of the overwhelming power from Mega Evolution. As a Mega Tyranitar, its instincts have only become more destructive, to the point where it may not even be able to hear its Trainer's orders.

Dark blue or black plate-like protrusions run down the length of its back, and there are two smaller, more pointed ones on the end of its tail. Lugia can fold back these plates to increase its speed. Lugia is covered in many scales that protect it from attacks. It has large wings that resemble hands. Though it is gender unknown, as depicted in The Mystery is History, a young Lugia has been seen, suggesting there is a breeding population, at least in the anime's timeline. In the same episode, Lugia has been shown to be fiercely protective of its young. Lugia leads the legendary birds. When they fight over territory, Lugia is the only Pok\u00e9mon that can quell their ceaseless fighting, as observed in the second Pok\u00e9mon movie. Much like the birds, it possesses the ability to control the weather; most notably, it can calm and give rise to storms. It is said that a light flutter of its wings is capable of causing winds powerful enough to tear a regular house down. If it were to flap its wings, it could hypothetically spawn storms lasting as long as 40 days. Lugia is capable of splitting islands like the Whirl Islands into smaller islands. It is highly intelligent, and because of the devastating power it could accidentally inflict, it isolates itself deep underwater and tends to sleep in solitude. It is extremely rare and is hardly ever seen. Lugia has been referred to as the guardian of the seas. There are rumors Lugia would appear during the night of a storm. Lugia loves Lugia Treats made by Snacksworth, who once encountered it in the past. Lugia is the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Aeroblast.

It is often viewed as the leader of the Legendary beasts. In the anime, it is associated with Marshadow. Ho-Oh is an avian Pok\u00e9mon resembling a phoenix and a peacock. Its feathers are predominantly gold and red, with yellow tail-feathers, a white underside, and green feathers at the tip of its wings. Ho-Oh has a green stripe on its neck, a yellow beak, black rings around its red eyes, and a feathered, yellow crest on its head. Ho-Oh's wings are prismatic, causing it to trail a rainbow behind it. It has darkly colored feet and legs with four toes and long talons. Ho-Oh is considered the guardian of the skies and has a mythical power to resurrect the dead. Prior to Generation VI, Ho-Oh was the only known Pok\u00e9mon capable of learning the move Sacred Fire. It is said that when it flies its huge wings create bright, colorful rainbows. The rare few who bear witness to Ho-Oh are promised eternal happiness. Ho-Oh used to perch at the top of the various towers located across the Johto region: the Bell Tower until the Brass Tower was destroyed by fire and the Goldenrod Tower in ancient times. It now presumably flies through the world's skies in search of a Trainer with a pure heart. Ho-Oh loves Ho-Oh Treats made by Snacksworth, who once witnessed it flying over him in the past.",
