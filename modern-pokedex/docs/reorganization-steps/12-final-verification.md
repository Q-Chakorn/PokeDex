## Rollback Plan (if needed)

If critical issues are found:

```bash
# Check git status
git status
git log --oneline -10

# Selective rollback if needed

# Full rollback (last resort)
git reset --hard HEAD~[number-of-commits]
```

## Final Steps

### 2. Commit Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: reorganize project structure for better maintainability

- Move config files to config/ directory
- Organize scripts by purpose in scripts/ directory  
- Restructure assets with logical grouping
- Create barrel exports for cleaner imports
- Add comprehensive documentation
- Maintain backward compatibility"
```

### 3. Create Documentation Index
```bash
# Create or update docs/README.md with links to all documentation
```

## Completion
