# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a modern, responsive Pokédex web application that provides an intuitive interface for browsing and viewing Pokémon information. The application will support multiple languages (English and Thai), theme switching (dark/light modes), and modern deployment options. The initial implementation will be frontend-only using static data or public APIs, with architecture designed to easily integrate with a custom backend in the future.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Pokémon enthusiast, I want to browse through a list of Pokémon with modern UI design, so that I can have an enjoyable and visually appealing experience while exploring Pokémon data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a grid/list view of Pokémon with their images, names, and basic information
2. WHEN a user scrolls through the list THEN the system SHALL implement smooth scrolling and responsive design that works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
3. WHEN displaying Pokémon information THEN the system SHALL show at minimum: name, image, type(s), and Pokédex number
4. WHEN the user interacts with the interface THEN the system SHALL provide modern UI elements with smooth animations and transitions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user who speaks Thai, I want to switch the application language between English and Thai, so that I can use the application in my preferred language.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL default to English language
2. WHEN a user clicks the language toggle THEN the system SHALL switch all text content between English (EN) and Thai (TH)
3. WHEN language is changed THEN the system SHALL persist the language preference in local storage
4. WHEN the application reloads THEN the system SHALL remember and apply the user's previously selected language
5. WHEN displaying Pokémon names THEN the system SHALL show localized names when available, falling back to English names when Thai translations are not available

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user with different lighting preferences, I want to toggle between dark and light themes, so that I can use the application comfortably in different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL default to light theme
2. WHEN a user clicks the theme toggle THEN the system SHALL switch between dark and light color schemes
3. WHEN theme is changed THEN the system SHALL persist the theme preference in local storage
4. WHEN the application reloads THEN the system SHALL remember and apply the user's previously selected theme
5. WHEN switching themes THEN the system SHALL apply smooth transitions for all color changes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view detailed information about a specific Pokémon, so that I can learn more about its characteristics, stats, and abilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on a Pokémon from the list THEN the system SHALL display a detailed view with comprehensive information
2. WHEN viewing Pokémon details THEN the system SHALL show: name, image, type(s), height, weight, abilities, base stats, and description
3. WHEN in detail view THEN the system SHALL provide a way to navigate back to the main list
4. WHEN displaying stats THEN the system SHALL use visual representations (progress bars, charts) for better user experience

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to search and filter Pokémon, so that I can quickly find specific Pokémon or browse by categories.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user types in the search box THEN the system SHALL filter Pokémon by name in real-time
2. WHEN a user selects type filters THEN the system SHALL show only Pokémon matching the selected type(s)
3. WHEN search or filters are applied THEN the system SHALL update the URL to allow bookmarking and sharing of filtered results
4. WHEN no results match the search/filter criteria THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate "no results" message

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** ~~As a developer or system administrator, I want the application to be containerized with Docker, so that it can be easily deployed and run in different environments.~~ (REMOVED)

#### Acceptance Criteria (REMOVED)

1. ~~WHEN building the application THEN the system SHALL include a Dockerfile that creates a production-ready container~~ (REMOVED)
2. ~~WHEN running the Docker container THEN the system SHALL serve the application on a configurable port (default 3000)~~ (REMOVED)
3. ~~WHEN the container starts THEN the system SHALL be accessible via web browser without additional configuration~~ (REMOVED)
4. ~~WHEN building the Docker image THEN the system SHALL optimize for small image size and fast startup time~~ (REMOVED)

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a future developer, I want the frontend architecture to support backend integration, so that the application can be easily extended with custom API endpoints later.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN designing the data layer THEN the system SHALL use an abstraction layer that can switch between static data and API calls
2. WHEN making data requests THEN the system SHALL implement a service pattern that can be easily modified to call backend APIs
3. WHEN handling data THEN the system SHALL use TypeScript interfaces that match expected backend data structures
4. WHEN implementing state management THEN the system SHALL structure it to easily accommodate real-time data updates from a backend
